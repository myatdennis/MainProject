// DEPRECATED: TypeScript source of the auth routes. The production runtime now imports
// `server/routes/auth.js` (JavaScript). This TypeScript implementation was intentionally
// removed from the runtime to avoid Node attempting to load `.ts` files in production.
// To keep the repo type-safe, we export a default placeholder to satisfy imports.
const router: any = null;
export default router;
