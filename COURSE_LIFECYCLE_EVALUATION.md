## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Video System Enhancement**
The recently implemented enhanced video system provides:
- ✅ Multi-source support (upload, YouTube, Vimeo, direct URL)
- ✅ Professional video player with full controls
- ✅ Progress tracking and completion requirements
- ✅ Accessibility features (transcripts, captions)

**Next Steps**: Integrate with completion workflow and analytics

### **State Management**
Current localStorage approach needs evolution:
```typescript
// Recommended: Add real-time sync layer
interface CourseStore {
  // Existing functionality
  saveCourse(course: Course): void;
  
  // Add real-time capabilities
  subscribeToChanges(courseId: string, callback: (course: Course) => void): void;
  syncWithServer(): Promise<void>;
  getConflicts(): CourseConflict[];
}
```

### **Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Add code splitting for admin features
const AdminCourseBuilder = lazy(() => import('./pages/Admin/AdminCourseBuilder'));

// Implement video preloading
const useVideoPreloader = (nextVideoUrl: string) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (nextVideoUrl) {
      const link = document.createElement('link');
      link.rel = 'preload';
      link.as = 'video';
      link.href = nextVideoUrl;
      document.head.appendChild(link);
    }
  }, [nextVideoUrl]);
};
```
