# Video Upload Persistence Fix

## Problem
User uploaded a video through the course editor, but when viewing the lesson in LMS, it was still showing the fallback video with message: 
> "üöß Demo Video: No video URL found in lesson content. Playing fallback video for demonstration."

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **two-fold**:

### 1. Video URL Validation Bug (Fixed Earlier)
- LMSModule.tsx had faulty validation logic that incorrectly excluded uploaded videos
- Fixed by simplifying validation to only check for valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs

### 2. Course Data Persistence Bug (Main Issue)
- When videos were uploaded in AdminCourseBuilder, they updated local React state
- However, changes were NOT being saved to localStorage
- LMS loaded course data from localStorage, which still had old data without the uploaded video

## Technical Details

### Course Data Flow
1. **Course Builder**: Loads course from localStorage ‚Üí Updates local state
2. **Video Upload**: Uploads to Supabase ‚Üí Updates local state ‚Üí ‚ùå **NOT SAVED**
3. **LMS Navigation**: Loads course from localStorage ‚Üí Missing uploaded video

### The Missing Save Calls
- `updateModule()` function updated local state but didn't call `courseStore.saveCourse()`
- This meant video uploads and other lesson changes weren't persisted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed updateModule Function
```tsx
const updateModule = (moduleId: string, updates: Partial<Module>) => {
  setCourse(prev => {
    const updatedCourse = {
      ...prev,
      modules: (prev.modules || []).map(module =>
        module.id === moduleId ? { ...module, ...updates } : module
      )
    };
    
    // Save the updated course to localStorage
    courseStore.saveCourse(updatedCourse);
    
    return updatedCourse;
  });
};
```

### 2. Added Auto-Save Mechanism
```tsx
// Auto-save course changes with debouncing
useEffect(() => {
  if (course.id && course.id !== 'new') {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      courseStore.saveCourse(course);
      console.log('üìù Auto-saved course:', course.title);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
}, [course]);
```

## Result
‚úÖ **Video uploads now persist correctly**:
1. Upload video in Course Builder ‚Üí Saves to Supabase + localStorage
2. Navigate to LMS ‚Üí Loads updated course data from localStorage  
3. Video plays correctly instead of showing fallback

## Testing
1. Upload a video in Admin ‚Üí Course Builder
2. Navigate to LMS ‚Üí View the lesson
3. Uploaded video should now play instead of BigBuckBunny fallback

## Files Modified
- `/src/pages/Admin/AdminCourseBuilder.tsx` - Added persistence to updateModule + auto-save
- `/src/pages/LMS/LMSModule.tsx` - Fixed video URL validation (done earlier)

## Technical Benefits
- **Immediate Persistence**: Changes save as you make them
- **Debounced Auto-Save**: Prevents excessive localStorage writes
- **Reliable Video URLs**: All valid HTTP URLs now work correctly
- **Better UX**: No more lost work when navigating between admin/LMS
