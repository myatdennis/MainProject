# Video Fallback Fix

## Problem
Videos were not playing properly - even when valid video URLs were provided, the system was showing the fallback video (BigBuckBunny.mp4) instead of the actual uploaded videos.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/src/pages/LMS/LMSModule.tsx` around lines 515-525. The validation logic had two bugs:

1. **Incorrect uploaded video detection**: The code checked for URLs starting with `"uploaded:"` but Supabase storage returns normal HTTP URLs
2. **Wrong exclusion logic**: The validation explicitly excluded uploaded videos with `!isUploadedVideo` even though uploaded videos have valid HTTP URLs

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed incorrect uploaded video detection**: Deleted the `isUploadedVideo` variable and its related logic
2. **Simplified validation**: Now only checks for valid HTTP/blob/data URLs without excluding any specific patterns
3. **Cleaned up error messages**: Removed references to the non-existent `isUploadedVideo` variable

## Code Changes
- **File**: `/src/pages/LMS/LMSModule.tsx`
- **Lines**: 515-535 (validation logic)
- **Lines**: 630 (error message display)

## Result
Now all videos with valid HTTP URLs (including those uploaded to Supabase storage) will play correctly instead of falling back to the demo video.

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Uploading a video in the Admin Course Builder
2. Viewing the lesson in the LMS
3. Verifying the uploaded video plays instead of the fallback
